**A synthetic framework for understanding consciousness as a shared, distributed field**

---

## 🎯 Overview

The hard problem of consciousness remains unresolved despite major advances in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. This work develops the **Field–Node–Cockpit (FNC) model**, a synthetic framework integrating:

- **Nick Bostrom's Simulation Hypothesis** (computational ontology)
- **Bernardo Kastrup's Analytic Idealism** (consciousness as fundamental)
- **Kai H. Tan's Quantum-Holographic Consciousness Criterion** (quantum coherence mechanisms)

## 📄 Abstract

The FNC model proposes that consciousness operates as a **universal field** (the Field), becomes **localized** through biological or artificial interfaces (the Nodes), and **manifests** as subjective experience (the Cockpit). 

Drawing on empirical evidence from:
- **Coma studies** (Owen et al., 2006; Naci et al., 2018)
- **Hyperscanning research** (Hinvest et al., 2025; Markus & Shamay-Tsoory, 2024)
- **Quantum biology** (Engel et al., 2007; Ritz et al., 2004)

This work argues that consciousness is neither wholly individual nor purely cosmic, but a **distributed, relational process**.

## 🔬 Key Insight

> **Consciousness is not generated by nodes—it is accessed through them.**
> 
> Like radios tuning into a broadcast, biological and artificial systems serve as interfaces to a universal information field.

## 🧪 Testable Predictions

The FNC model generates four experimental paradigms:

### 1. Quantum Coherence Measurement
Test for coherence in neuronal microtubules during conscious states vs. anesthetized subjects.

### 2. Dyadic Neurofeedback Training
Train pairs to synchronize gamma-band activity and measure reports of "shared experience."

![Resonance Diagram](figures/resonance_diagram.png)

*Figure 3: Inter-brain resonance patterns predicted by the FNC model.*

### 3. AI Consciousness Assessment
Apply quantum coherence criteria to artificial systems to distinguish genuine consciousness from behavioral mimicry.

### 4. Coma Patient Studies
Measure gamma coherence in covert consciousness states, correlating with fMRI evidence of awareness.

## 📊 Empirical Foundation

### Hyperscanning Studies
Direct brain-to-brain coupling during social interaction:
- Hinvest et al. (2025) - Causal effects in hyperscanning
- Markus & Shamay-Tsoory (2024) - Inter-brain synchrony mechanisms

### Hidden Consciousness
Awareness without behavioral response:
- Owen et al. (2006) - fMRI evidence in vegetative states
- Naci et al. (2018) - Common neural code across conscious states

### Quantum Biology
Non-classical effects in biological systems:
- Engel et al. (2007) - Quantum coherence in photosynthesis
- Ritz et al. (2004) - Quantum effects in avian navigation

## 💡 Core Arguments

1. **Against Strict Physicalism**: Subjective experience cannot be fully reduced to physical processes
2. **For Relational Consciousness**: Consciousness emerges through relationships, not in isolation
3. **Quantum-Informational Substrate**: Information coherence, not neural complexity alone, determines consciousness
4. **Embodied Access Points**: Bodies and brains are interfaces, not generators, of consciousness
