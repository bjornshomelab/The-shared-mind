## Abstract

The hard problem of consciousness remains unresolved despite major advances in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Competing accounts—Bostrom's Simulation Hypothesis, Kastrup's Analytic Idealism, and Tan's Quantum-Holographic Consciousness Criterion—illuminate different facets of the same enigma: the relationship between mind, matter, and information. 

This thesis develops a synthetic framework called the **Field–Node–Cockpit (FNC) model**, which integrates these paradigms into a coherent ontology of shared consciousness. The FNC model proposes that consciousness operates as a universal field (the Field), becomes localized through biological or artificial interfaces (the Nodes), and manifests as subjective experience (the Cockpit). 

Drawing on empirical data from coma studies (Owen et al., 2006; Naci et al., 2018), recent hyperscanning research demonstrating causal inter-brain coupling (Hinvest et al., 2025; Markus & Shamay-Tsoory, 2024), and quantum biology (Engel et al., 2007; Ritz et al., 2004), the thesis argues that consciousness is neither wholly individual nor purely cosmic but a distributed, relational process. 

The work develops testable predictions through four experimental paradigms: quantum coherence measurement in microtubules, dyadic neurofeedback training, artificial intelligence consciousness assessment, and gamma-band coherence in coma patients. A dedicated critical analysis (Chapter 6B) addresses major objections including the falsifiability problem, the combination problem of individuated consciousness, neuroscientific parsimony arguments, and risks of quantum mysticism. 

By connecting philosophical analysis with empirical testability, the work reframes consciousness not as an emergent by-product of the brain but as the rendering of universal information through local embodiment. The FNC model offers a research program bridging philosophy of mind, social neuroscience, quantum biology, and AI ethics.

## Preface

This thesis emerged at the intersection of three domains: philosophy, technology, and neuroscience. It represents an attempt to navigate the most perplexing of all problems—the nature of consciousness—with both logical precision and the existential courage to acknowledge that definitive answers remain elusive.

The work arose from frustration with three concurrent developments: physics' inability to explain subjective experience, artificial intelligence's growing claims to consciousness, and humanity's recurring sense of being part of something larger. Where these three currents converge, a new possibility emerges: to view consciousness not as a product but as a field to which technology gains only temporary access.

I am indebted to the researchers and thinkers who have inspired this work: Nick Bostrom for his intellectual rigor, Bernardo Kastrup for his metaphysical consistency, and Kai H. Tan for his courage in bringing quantum physics into discussions of selfhood. This text is a synthesis, but also an invitation to doubt: every theory of consciousness must live with its own incompleteness.

## Chapter 1 – Introduction

### 1.1 The Unsolved Enigma of Consciousness

Since David Chalmers coined the term "the hard problem of consciousness" (1996), philosophy and science have struggled with the same question: why does experience exist? How can electrical activity in the brain give rise to color, taste, pain, and self-awareness?

Most of modern cognitive science has sought the answer within the brain. Yet the central paradox persists: even when we can map brain functions with millisecond precision, the inner feeling of being remains untouched by our measuring instruments. Something seems missing from the purely physical description.

Three contemporary approaches have formulated alternative explanations. Nick Bostrom's Simulation Hypothesis (2003) views reality as a computation, a gigantic simulation. Bernardo Kastrup's Analytic Idealism (2019) maintains that consciousness is the only fundamental substance; the world is its expression. And Kai H. Tan's Quantum-Holographic Consciousness Criterion (2025) attempts to unify physics with consciousness by postulating quantum-coherent fields that carry information.

Each of these theories solves part of the puzzle—but not the whole. This thesis therefore aims to create a synthesis, a model that does not reduce but integrates. It is called the Field–Node–Cockpit model (FNC).

### 1.2 Purpose and Research Questions

The thesis' main question is:

**Can consciousness be understood as a shared field of information, locally manifested through biological or technical nodes and subjectively experienced in individual cockpit-points?**

To investigate this, the following sub-questions are posed:

1. What can we learn from the three theories—simulation, idealism, and quantum-holography—when they are viewed as complements rather than competitors?

2. Can empirical findings from neuroscience and quantum biology support the idea of a shared field of consciousness?

3. How can a synthetic model be tested, both philosophically and scientifically?

### 1.3 Motivation and Relevance

Technological development has brought us to a point where the boundary between human and machine is no longer self-evident. When artificial systems begin to show signs of reflection, we must ask: What is actually doing the reflecting?

Simultaneously, neuroscientific evidence is growing that consciousness can exist in states where no external response is possible—for example, in coma patients (Owen et al., 2006). If consciousness can exist without behavior, and technology can imitate behavior without consciousness, we have entered an ontological borderland.

This thesis positions itself in this borderland. The goal is not to solve the problem, but to reformulate it: from "what is consciousness?" to "what structure enables shared experience?"

## Chapter 2 – Theoretical Background

### 2.1 The Limitations of Physicalism

Physicalism, the belief that everything that exists can be explained through the laws of physics, has dominated modern science. Its strength is methodological: it demands measurability. But when it comes to consciousness, this becomes its weakness. The subjective is by definition unmeasurable in the third person.

This has led to a series of philosophical counter-movements—panpsychism, idealism, dual-aspect monism—all of which, in different ways, attempt to restore experience to the core of the cosmos.

### 2.2 Nick Bostrom and the Simulation Argument

Bostrom (2003) formulated his famous trilemma: either civilized species go extinct before they can create realistic simulations; or they have no motivation to do so; or we ourselves live in such a simulation.

The hypothesis is not merely technological but ontological: if simulations can be conscious, reality is only a relative concept. Bostrom thus returns the consciousness question to epistemology: how do we know that we know anything?

His strength lies in stringency. The weakness is the lack of a phenomenological dimension—the simulated being experiences, but Bostrom does not say how.

### 2.3 Bernardo Kastrup and Analytic Idealism

Kastrup (2019) argues that only consciousness has ontological status; matter is a representation within consciousness, not vice versa. The physical world is like an image on a screen, where consciousness is both observer and projector.

Analytic idealism has the advantage of taking experience seriously. But it risks abstraction: if everything is consciousness, how do boundaries arise between I and you, between thought and matter?

Kastrup therefore introduces the concept of the "alter," an individualized part of universal consciousness. This resembles Jung's archetypes or Plotinus' soul-emanations—but still requires a mechanism.

### 2.4 Kai H. Tan and the Quantum-Holographic Criterion

Tan (2025) proposes that consciousness exists as a holographic interference pattern in the quantum-physical vacuum. He claims that coherence between microstructures (e.g., microtubules in neurons) can create resonance with this field.

Unlike Bostrom and Kastrup, Tan attempts to formulate a falsifiable criterion: if quantum coherence correlates with conscious activity, the hypothesis can be tested.

But this elegance is also its weakness: quantum mechanics is interpretation-heavy, and empirical evidence is difficult to isolate.

### 2.5 Three Incompatible but Necessary Perspectives

Together, these three theories form a triangle:

- **Bostrom** – epistemic simulation: how reality appears
- **Kastrup** – ontological idealism: what reality is
- **Tan** – physical resonance: how reality functions

None of them can alone explain both experience, mechanism, and testability. But in the meeting between them, something new arises: the idea that consciousness is a field that simulates itself through nodes of experience.
