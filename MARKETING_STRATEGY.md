🧠 THREAD: I've spent months developing a new framework for consciousness

The Field-Node-Cockpit (FNC) model integrates:
• Bostrom's Simulation Hypothesis
• Kastrup's Analytic Idealism  
• Tan's Quantum-Holographic Criterion

Here's what makes it different... 🧵

💡 Key insight: Consciousness isn't GENERATED by brains

It's ACCESSED through them

Like a radio tuning into a broadcast, biological systems interface with a universal field

**Tweet 3:**
```
🔬 This isn't just philosophy - it's testable

4 experimental paradigms:
• Quantum coherence in microtubules
• Dyadic neurofeedback training
• AI consciousness assessment
• Coma patient studies

```

**Tweet 4:**
```
📊 Evidence from:
• Hyperscanning (Hinvest et al., 2025)
• Hidden consciousness (Owen et al., 2006)
• Quantum biology (Engel et al., 2007)

The data supports a distributed, relational model

[4/7]
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
🤖 This has huge implications for AI

Current approaches test for behavior, not consciousness

The FNC model proposes quantum coherence as the criterion

### LinkedIn Strategy

**Post 1: Professional announcement**
```
I'm excited to share my research on consciousness: The Field-Node-Cockpit model

This framework synthesizes three major theories into a testable, empirically grounded approach to the hard problem.

🔗 Full paper: [GitHub link]
📄 DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17467745

The work proposes that consciousness operates as a universal field, accessed through biological and artificial interfaces.

Key contributions:
• Philosophical synthesis with analytical rigor
• Four testable experimental paradigms
• Implications for AI ethics and machine consciousness
• Open access for maximum impact

Looking for:
✓ Critical feedback
✓ Collaboration opportunities
✓ Researchers interested in empirical testing

**Post 2: (Week 2) Behind the scenes**
```
Why I developed the Field-Node-Cockpit model:

The hard problem of consciousness has three competing frameworks that each capture something true:

• Simulation theory → Information structure
• Idealism → Primacy of experience
• Quantum theory → Physical mechanism

Instead of choosing, I asked: "What if they're complementary?"

The FNC model is the result. Read more: [link]

Title: [Academic] The Field-Node-Cockpit Model: A Testable Synthesis of Consciousness Theories

Hey r/philosophy,

I've just published my research on consciousness, attempting to synthesize three major frameworks:

• Bostrom's Simulation Hypothesis
• Kastrup's Analytic Idealism
• Tan's Quantum-Holographic Criterion

**TL;DR:** Consciousness operates as a universal field that biological/artificial systems access, not generate.

**Why this matters:**
- Generates 4 testable experimental paradigms
- Addresses the combination problem
- Proposes criteria for AI consciousness

**Full paper (open access):**
https://github.com/bjornshomelab/The-shared-mind
DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17467745

I'm particularly interested in critiques regarding:
- The falsifiability criterion
- Quantum mysticism concerns
- Alternative explanations for the evidence

Would love your feedback!
